 Introduction
   * Besides establishing detection thresholds, it is also important to know when the user's immersion breaks.
   * Paper hypothesizes that degree of unnoticed manipulation is significantly different from the detection threshold when the user is immersed in a task
      * (Distractors can help improve immersion, giving the user a task like playing a game also makes them more immersed)
   * Previous research on thresholds for the allowed degree of motion manipulation has measured perceptual detection thresholds in controlled psychophysical experiments.
      * While this is a useful basic metric to establish a lower bound on the allowed degree of redirection, the paper argues that additional metrics are required to judge redirection techniques in real world applications
   * Proposes the threshold of limited immersion (TLI) as a complementary metric.
   * Paper presents results of three studies
      * a study on the methodical development of a paradigm to assess the TLI
      * a study to apply the method for measuring TLI using slowly varying rotational gains during a search and collect task
      * the third study is a control/baseline measurement of cybersickness induced by the experimental setup with no redirection applied
Related Work
   * Contains sections on Spatial Compression Methods, Human Factors and Perception, Terminology: Presence and Immersion, Detection Thresholds and Breaks in Presence, Cybersickness
   * Cybersickness
      * Cybersickness occurs because of conflicts between the visual and vestibular system, because the users do not (yet) possess mechanisms to maintain postural stability, or because adverse input tricks the body into thinking that it ingested something poisonous. 
      * Gender, age or prior exposure account for emergence of cybersickness
      * Women due to their larger field of view have to handle more visual input in comparison to men
         * (would this correlate with Bjørn's thoughts that FoV might affect redirection?)
         * (Regardless, the FoV of the screen would be the same for both genders though)
      * immersion should be seen as a third dimension after detection and cybersickness thresholds
Hypotheses and Logic of Empirical Procedure
   * Authors believe that no single spatial compression method will cover everything. A synergistic combination of different redirection methods is necessary
   * Two existing methods to assess how much redirection we can do is Detection Thresholds(DT) and breaks in presence(BIP)
      * DT is measured in a controlled setting using a established 2AFC paradigm for measuring psychophysical thresholds. 
      * BIP are generally measured through verbal exclamation. They capture the point in time where the presence degrades from a high to low state
   * Threshold of limited immersion
      * requires a measurement procedure where participants actively report an effect, even if they are not directly informed about it
      * users are not asked if they can reliably detect a manipulation, but rather when they actually feel that a manipulation interferes with the quality of their experience
      * TLI should be seen as a complimentary metric for detection thresholds
   * (Sample sizes are relatively small: (1: 16, 2: 35, 3: 10). Given that it is a VR experiment, it is hard to criticize that though. What the population was and how it was sampled is not mentioned though)
Experiments
   * Samsung GearVR used for measurement
      * (Not ideal due to the 60hz refresh rate and not being connected to powerful hardware)
   * 3m x 4m tracking area
   * Headphones with ambient noise was used as being without made it easier to detect when the users were close to a wall
   * Subjects were not informed beforehand that their rotation would be manipulated, only that they might get nauseous and that they should feel free to quit the experiment if they felt too uncomfortable. They could take a break at any time and were offered sweets and water
   * No compensation was given. Participants with a history of epilepsy and pregnant women were excluded
Experiment 1
   * Participants would press a button if the virtual environment "felt strange or unnatural"
   * Semi structured interviews after the experiment to examine in detail why the button was pressed and informed the participant about the rotational gains.
   * a fair amount of participants seem to have struggled to understand when to report inconsistencies. They were thus asked to mention it verbally instead of pressing a button if they noticed anything. 
      * they were also asked to think aloud 
   * In the end, there were some limitations with the results that the authors wanted to address for the next iteration.
Experiment 2
   * Pre questionnaire, VR task and post questionnaire
   * to check whether individual factors had impact on thresholds for rotational gains the paper measured
      * demographical data like age, gender, education and pupil distance
      * personality factors like self efficacy with technology and the ability of mental rotation using the paper folding test
      * VR related factors like the tendency to percieve immersion, experience with VR/AR technology, tolerance towards nausea inducing activities like reading when being driven by a car
   * Results show that TLI is not equivalent to the detection threshold. 
   * users were not really disturbed by high gains
   * Individual TLI is pretty diverse
   * (I dont feel like they described the definition for the TLI well enough for me to understand it)
   * In general, there seems to be a individual robustness to rotary manipulation
General discussion
   * TLI is assessed by adapting how a break of immersion is reported.
   * With the final procedure, subjects reported the break in immersion as soon as they noticed it, which was validated by applying the method and interviewing participants about their reporting behaviour after the experiment. 
   * High gains do not break immersion as easily as gains below 1
   * The control experiment did not yield any significant cybersickness so cybersickness in general for experiment 2 was attributed to rotational gain. 
Limitations
   * more than half of the trials ended up at a gain of 2.0 is unsatisfying. There has to be some biased factors due to that
   * slowly decreasing and increasing rotational gain does not allow for a direct comparison with the established detection thresholds. 
   * the proposed method of assessing TLI is arguably too time consuming and costly. Thinking aloud requires too much attention of the examiner. 
   * there might be examiner bias when using this procedure. 
   * the sample was too homogenous
Conclusion
  * TLI was proposed. 
  * users report a subjective break in immersion without being informed about the applied manipulation. 
  * findings contribute to spatial compression by proposing an additional quality of user experience. This helps understanding the limitations of effective spatial compression with respect to user diversity and enables larger virtual environments to be explored in limited spaces
    * (does it enable larger virtual environments to be explored in limited spaces though? To my understanding this just provided an additional quality measure with its fair share of limitations) 
  * (I spent way too much time reading this + writing notes (~4 hours) so some optimizing might be in order)
    * (Focus on abstract/introduction/conclusion first)

  Abstract
   * predictors for cybersickness are not sufficiently explored when redirection is applied
   * User study was conducted with semi-structured interviews to get quantitative and qualitative results in this domain. 
   * Results show that cybersickness arises, but also eases ten minutes after the exposure
      * (Both me and PMS were sick for several hours after Bjørn's experiment though!)
   * Quantitative results show that a tolerance for cybersickness might be related to self-efficacy constructs and therefore be learnable or trainable
   * Qualitative results indicate that cybersickness is dependent on factors like intensity and duration
  Introduction
   * Influence of human factors on cybersickness is examined
  Related Work
   * The sensory conflict theory suggests that a mismatch between diferent sensory subsystems causes symptoms of cybersickness
     * While commonly employed to explain symptoms, the theory has been criticized for it’s lack of predictive power
   * Experience with VR can be a factor in cybersickness
   * Scene complexity and realism can increase discomfort
   * Distractors
      * Dynamically moving objects or agents are used to block the path of the user and induce a turning motion. 
      * Scene manipulations while the user is distracted also works
   * (The studies of Steinicke et al and Razzaque et all are brought up in a lot of these RW papers)
  Methods
   * Experiment design was equivalent to the one described in Schmitz et al's study
   * Sample of 52 participants
      * 12 participants aborted the experiment before getting to the final condition due to cybersickness
   * Participants were informed that they should stop the experiment if they felt uncomfortable, but were not informed of the redirection technique
  Discussion
   * sample was homogenous
   * previous findings that women tend to be more susceptible to cybersickness was replicated
      * authors dont know if this is reporting bias or not
  Conclusion
   * Experiment consisted of collecting virtual pillars as long as they percieve motion as natural
      * (This is pretty similar to the first study they did)
   * Before, right after and 10 minutes after were the times where cybersickness was measured using the SSQ method
   * Authors came to the conclusion that cybersickness and limited immersion are thresholds that need to be considered when implementing redirected walking algorithms
      * (This paper came after their study in the threshold on limited immersion)
  * (Both of the papers by these authors used dynamic gains so they did not really look at specific threshold levels that would keep the user comfortable)
  * (They keep mentioning that women might get cybersickness more easily than men due to having a wider field of view, but the monitor itself has the same field of view for both. Do they mean it in the relation that the "projection" of everything is slightly different due to the difference in physical field of view?)
  * (They also forgot to mention what VR headset they used for testing, but I would imagine this is the same as their previous study which used a Samsung Gear VR. This still isn't exactly the best hardware to test with)

  title={Assessing Vignetting as a Means to Reduce VR Sickness During Amplified Head Rotations},
  author={Norouzi, Nahal and Bruder, Gerd and Welch, Greg},
  year={2018},
  abstract={
  *  Redirected and amplified head movements have the potential to
provide more natural interaction with virtual environments (VEs)
than using controller-based input, which causes large discrepancies
between visual and vestibular self-motion cues and leads to
increased VR sickness. 
  * However, such amplified head movements
may also exacerbate VR sickness symptoms over no amplification.
Several general methods have been introduced to reduce VR sickness
for controller-based input inside a VE, including a popular
vignetting method that gradually reduces the field of view.
  * In this paper, we investigate the use of vignetting to reduce VR
sickness when using amplified head rotations instead of controllerbased
input. We also investigate whether the induced VR sickness
is a result of the user’s head acceleration or velocity by introducing
two different modes of vignetting, one triggered by acceleration and
the other by velocity. 
   * Our dependent measures were pre and post
VR sickness questionnaires as well as estimated discomfort levels
that were assessed each minute of the experiment. Our results show
interesting effects between a baseline condition without vignetting,
as well as the two vignetting methods, generally indicating that
the vignetting methods did not succeed in reducing VR sickness for
most of the participants and, instead, lead to a significant increase.
We discuss the results and potential explanations of our findings.

  * (sample of 15 people might make it a bit hard to draw the conclusion that Vignetting(Adapting FOV) makes people more sick, even though the majority did better without)
Introduction
  * "Comfort Modes" have been used in the gaming industry to reduce VR sickness for controller-based input
     * Includes gradual reduction of FOV,(sometimes called vignetting) as well as blurring of the view and rotation snapping techniques.
     * Google Earth VR also makes use of a similar vignetting method for its comfort mode. 
     * All these comfort modes have primarily been used for controller based input. This paper looks into whether it is as useful amplified head rotations.
     * Two vignette methods presented which are based on velocity and accelleration
        * (Aren't the comfort modes static FOV reductions though? Might dynamically changing the FOV result in more confusion/sickness?)
        * (edit: seems like related work has made use of variable FOV reductions to some success when using controller-based input)
Related Work
   * Detectability of the rotation amplification and its relationship with different FOVs has been the focus of several researchers(see paper for these citations). * VR sickness/cybersickness has many similarities with simulator sickness and motion sickness although different people experience it differently based on their level of susceptibility to it. 
      * Eye strain, stomach awareness, dizziness, nausea and headaches are common symptoms of VR sickness
   * Age, gender and illness might separately affect how susceptible one is to VR sickness.
   * Research has shown that smaller FOVs is positively correlated with reduction in VR sickness. It also reduces the user's sense of presence though
      * Bolas et al. patented the approach to gradually reduce the FOV only in situations that are known to cause VR sickness, such as when using a controller based input
      * Fernandes and Feiner tried vignette-based FOV reduction depending on angular velocity speed up. Reduction in discomfort was significant for controller-based input.
   * Based on the anecdotal results of some previous studies. The authors were interested in seeing whether velocity or acceleration based vignetting had a significant effect on VR sickness during amplified head rotations. 
Implementation
   * rotation gains were only applied for yaw rotations(y axis)
Experiment
   * 18 participants were recruited
      * all affiliated with the related institution
      * (no mention of sampling method)
      * 3 participants were removed as they had variables affecting their test results like being too sensitive to the VE and being rather exhausted before starting. 
      * final sample: 15 participants
   * HTC Vive used for the experiment
   * (General description of technology used is pretty good here compared to other papers at least. I wont mention the details here as it isn't necessarily relevant for the literature review though)
   * A virtual butterfly was used as a visual target to communicate rotation tasks
      * (This could kind of count as a distractor)
Experiment Methods
   * Three conditions
      * Control condition without vignetting, velocity based vignetting and acceleration based vignetting
      * order of conditions were randomized over the three consequtive days that the experiment took place
         * (sounds good)
         * The participants also had to rank their preferred one from the three they tried
   * VR sickness, discomfort, presence, preference and task performance were measured with the following:
      * SSQ to measure the level of VR sickness. This was filled out before and after each condition
      * DS(discomfort score) to measure the participants' sense of discomfort after each minute of the experience. (Asking the participant in the VE to answer how sick they felt on a scale from 0 to 10). This was answered verbally
      * SUS(Slater-Usoh-Steed) to measure sense of presence. This questionnaire was filled out after each condition
      * PR(preferred method of interaction): a ranking of each method 
      * PE: percentage of time when each participant was able to see the butterfly in their visual field.
         * This is an objective measure of whether the conditions had an effect on the task performance
    * Qualitative feedback was also gathered after the experiment where the participants were asked to give their impression of what might have caused them the discomfort.
       * (in this regard, it kind of makes sense to have a lower sample size as a lot of time was spent with each of them)
    * A gain of 3 on the yaw was used to allow participants to rotate 360 degrees without rotating their body at all
       * This was done to elicit noticeable sensory conflicts between the visual and vestibuar system for all users independent of their individual sensitivity threshold. 
Results
   * Sample is split into two groups
      * Group 1 with 11 participants that only showed detriments in terms of discomfort when using vignetting
      * Group 2 with 4 participants that had benefits in either vignetting conditions
   * (full results are seen in the paper)
Discussion
   * Authors were surprised to see that the majority experienced significantly more VR sickness for the vignette methods. 
   * They believe it is related to the differences in how we explore and visually scan a VE when using our heads compared to a hand held controller
   * Anecdotal observation: none of the participants noticed that head rotations were amplified.
      * It was surprising to see this since the gain was very high and far above the detection thresholds
Conclusion
   * To summarize, the results indicate that neither velocity or acceleration based vignetting help with reduction of VR sickness and instead lead to a significant increase in sickness symptoms for 11/15 participants.

  abstract={
   * Redirected walking provides a compelling solution to explore large virtual environments in a natural way. However, research literature provides few guidelines regarding trade-offs involved in selecting size and layout for physical tracked space. 
   * We designed a rigorously controlled benchmarking framework and conducted two simulated user experiments to systematically investigate how the total area and dimensions of the tracked space affect performance of steer-to-center and steer-to-orbit algorithms. 
   * The results indicate that minimum viable size of physical tracked space for these redirected walking algorithms is approximately 6m×6m with performance continuously improving in larger tracked spaces. 
   * At the same time, no “optimal” tracked space size can guarantee the absence of contacts with the boundary. We also found that square tracked spaces enabled best overall performance with steer-to-center algorithm also performing well in moderately elongated rectangular spaces. 
   * Finally, we demonstrate that introducing translation gains can provide a useful boost in performance, particularly when physical space is constrained. 
   * We conclude with the discussion of potential applications of our benchmarking toolkit to other problems related to performance of redirected walking platforms.

  Introduction
   * Redirected walking provides better cognitive maps of the environment, albeit at a limited cost of some cognitive load on the user. It does not interfere with navigation and spatial cognition either. 
     * (citations for these might be worth reading)
   * The goal of this paper is to evaluate the physical space requirements for RW while controlling for the most salient factors that may affect RW performance. 
     * The goal is to shed light on the optimal tradeoff between cost and performance for tracked space requirements
  Related work
   * Razzaque et al. introduced the concept of redirected walking
   * RW algorithms can be categorised into reactive or predictive algorithms
      * Reactive assumes no knowledge of the VE or future user direction. It relies on current travel direction, speed and position relative to the physical tracked space to steer the user. 
         * Examples of reactive algorithms are Steer to Center(S2C) and Steer to Orbit(S2O) which were initially proposed by Razzaque et al and later improved by Hodgson and Bachmann.
      * Predictive algorithms try to take advantage of the previous behaviour of the user and the structure of the VE to forecast user movement into the future.
         * These algorithms usually optimize the choice of steering action by searching among possible outcomes and applying different options in a near-term time horizon. 
   * The work of Peck et al. demonstrates that reset-like periodic reorientations may be enough to explore large VE's without other RW techniques.
   * The layout of the physical tracked space is a practical issue in a RW setup. 
   * Existing literature does not provide clear guidance when it comes to physical space requirements for a RW setup. 
   * S2C might beat S2O in one type of VE while another might be the opposite. 
  Our Approach
   * S2C and S2O primarily used as they are applicable to any given VE without needing to make assumptions. 
   * Effects of combining rotation, curvature and translation gains are investigated. 
      * translation gains + S2O/S2C
   * Common reset method used which stopped users at the boundary of the tracked space and reoriented them towards the center
      * (they did not specifically specify what the method is called though)
   * Simulated user approach
      * (this kind of disregards human factors though, doesn't it? This might not give accurate performance measurements)
   * everything implemented in Unity as a interactive framework
   * 2 experiments
      * 1: looking at square tracked spaces and the effect on RW performance
      * 2: looks at the differences between rectangular tracked spaces that have the same area, but differ in dimensions
  Experiment 1: what is the optimal tracked space size?
   * 5 RW algorithms used
      * S2C: injecting small visual rotations to steer the user towards the center of the tracked space. Implementation was based on the modified version introduced by Hodgson and Bachmann
      * S2O: similar to S2C, but the heuristic is to steer the user so they orbit around the center of the tracked space
      * CTG(center based translation gain): slowing down the user when they were moving away from the center of the tracked space. Based on unnoticeable threshold estimate by Steinicke et al. translation gain was set to 14 percent
      * Combined Algorithms (S2C+CTG, S2O+CTG): straightforward combination of the two
      * Control Condition: no redirection
   * Performance measurement
      * Checking the reset count is a good way to see how good the RW technique performs. 
   * S2C and S2O are not very effective in small tracked spaces
      * S2O requires at least 15 meters to get 10 percent effectiveness relative to no redirection and to outperform CTG
      * S2C requires at least 6 meters to achieve 10 percent effectiveness and to outperform CTG
      * In intermediate tracked spaces between 16-31 meters S2O outperforms S2C in a Long Walk path scenario(Walking in a infinite straight line)
  Experiment 1: discussion
   * Minimum viable tracked space requirements in a long walk scenario
      * S2C requires a tracked space of at least 6m x 6m for 10 percent relative effectiveness to no redirection
      * S2O needs a larger tracked space than S2C 
      * Translation gain relaxes the requirements a bit by effectively making the tracked space "bigger"
   * Data suggests 31m x 31m tracked space is enough to achieve infinite straight line walking in VR for any of the algorithms. 
      * This is in line with the earlier 30m x 30m estimate by Razzaque et al. and 35m x 35m by Hodgson and Bachmann
   * Near perfect performance was achieved by S2O in a tracked space of 22m x 22m. 
   * For very large spaces, it does not matter whether you use S2O or S2C
   * S2C is best for smaller/intermediate spaces (under 15m x 15m)
   * In practice, most tracked spaces are unlikely to exceed 10m x 10m so a fair amount of resets will be expected
      * Therefore, it is critical to design reset and reorientation mechanisms to seamlessly integrate into overall virtual reality experience.
         * (Which is exactly what distractors are aimed at)
   * For small tracked spaces combining S2C/S2O with translation gain provides a significant boost in effectiveness. 
      * Further research is needed to fully understand the effect of applying both curvature and translation gain though.
      * the primary concern is that using both might make it more noticeable
  Experiment 2: what is the optimal shape of the tracking space?
   * S2O and S2O+CTG performs best in square tracked spaces
   * CTG by itself does not appear to be sensitive to tracking space shape
   * In general: square shaped tracking spaces are the best choice across all algorithms
  Conclusions:
   * there is no single "optimal" size of a tracked space at least for reactive algorithms. 
   * It is prudent to concentrate on defining and achieving an acceptable level of resets and integration them more naturally into the experience. 
   * at 10m x 10m tracked space S2C reduces the number of resets vs no redirection by 27 percent. S2C+CTG meanwhile achieves the reduction by 46 percent
   * Square shaped tracking spaces are most suitable for redirection. Moderately elongated rectangular shapes are also fine
   * The study is a bit limited since it did not use real world users.
      * A more complete understanding of RW would require to assess the impact on the user in terms of perceptual and cognitive load as well as the levels of simulator sickness. 
      * In the future the authors want to include these features to predict the user's comfrot level across various algorithms
         * (This varies a lot on the individual though I would imagine)
   * (In general this paper can be used as a argument for working on distractors)
   * (Side note: these are the authors that made the redirected walking toolkit for Unity. They have a separate paper for it as well)

abstract={In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), users can control their virtual viewpoint by moving their tracked head and walking through the real world. Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.},

   * (Steinicke et al.'s paper on detection threshold estimation which has been cited a fair bit in previously read papers.)
  Introduction
   * Article presents a series of experiments where the authors have quantified how much humans can be redirected without seeing inconsistensies between real and virtual motions. 
  Related work
   * Yaw is the most often manipulated rotation for redirected walking (there are a lot of citations for this statement)
  Experiments
   * 10m x 7m darkened laboratory room
   * 3DVisor Z800 800x600 60hz HMD 
      * (Pretty old stuff)
   * Software ran at 30fps
   * Ambient noise provided with headphones or equivalent to prevent auditory feedback from the real world
      * (This is useful to keep in mind)
   * Participants walked around a 3D city environment
   * 14 participants
   * 2AFC task where the participant is forced to answer whether the rotation was smaller or greater than the real world counterpart
      * Asking "was this greater or not?" might introduce a bias to say no when the participant is unsure, hence using greater or smaller to avoid this problem. 
   * (specifics on how the thresholds are defined is mentioned in the paper, but I dont feel like I can sum them up in a easy manner so it might be best to just reread this section("Participants") if necessary)
  Experiment 1: discrimination between virtual and physical rotation
   * subjects were instructed to rotate on a physical spot and their rotation was mapped to a corresponding virtual rotation with gains applied
   * (this experiment is in general pretty similar to one of the experiments Bjørn did on newer hardware)
   * the subject would have to rotate 90 degrees virtually to look at a ball that was on eye height. 
   * range of 0.5-1.5 gains were tested in steps of 0.1. Each gain was tested 10 times in randomized order
   * subjects can be turned about 49 percent more or 20 percent without noticing the difference
   * In summary, the experiment showed that the subjects could not discriminate physical from virtual rotations over the reported range of gains
  Experiment 2: discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movement
   * seeing whether the subjects could detect translation gain
   * subjects can be manipulated physically by about 14 percent for downscaling and 26 percent for upscaling 
   * Subjects have a tendency to underestimate travel distances in virtual worlds which coincides with the asymmetry in the results. 
  Experiment 3: discrimination of path curvature
   * subjects were instructed to walk in a straight line in the VE while they were manipulated to walk in a curve
   * Having the subjects walk 2m first before starting to manipulate curve gain was done to avoid them walking in a triangle rather than a curve
   * Subjects can be reoriented by 13 degrees to the left or to the right after a walking distance of 5m. This corresponds to walking along a circular arc with the radius of ~22m. If you then have a lab with 40m x 40m size it should be possible to infinitely walk in a circle while the subject believes they are moving forward in a straight line. 
  Conclusion and Discussion
   * Subjects tolerate far greater gains when they are not aware of the manipulation, in particular when they are engaged in other primary tasks.
   * An earlier study by the authors found that a curvature gain of 0.64 was noticeable, but not very distracting which results in a circular arc with a 3.3m radius. This is far more practical. 
   * The thresholds proposed in this article provide the lower and upper bounds for the sensitivity towards redirected walking.  
     * But in most cases, much greater gains can be applied without the user noticing. 
   * Peck et al. used virtual objects like a butterfly in front of the user to distract them from reorientation. This allowed far larger manipulations.

abstract={Redirected walking (RDW) refers to a number of techniques that enable users to explore a virtual environment larger than the real physical space. These techniques are based on the introduction of a mismatch in rotation, translation and curvature between the virtual and real trajectories, quantified as rotational, translational and curvature gains. When these gains are applied within certain thresholds, the manipulation is unnoticeable and immersion is maintained. Existing studies on RDW thresholds reported a wide range of threshold values. These differences could be attributed to many factors such as individual differences, walking speed, or environment settings. In this paper, we propose a study to investigate one of the environment settings that could potentially influence curvature RDW thresholds: the environment size. The detailed description of the study is also provided, where the adaptive, 2-alternative forced choice method is used to identify the detection thresholds.},

title={I Can See on My Feet While Walking: Sensitivity to Translation Gains with Visible Feet}, 
year={2018}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={305-312}, 
abstract={Redirected walking allows users to explore immersive virtual environments by real walking even when the physical tracking space is limited. Redirected walking is usually implemented via translation gains, rotation gains, and curvature gains, while previous research was focused on identifying detection thresholds for such manipulations. To our knowledge, all previous experiments were conducted without a visual self-representation of the user in the virtual environment, in particular, without showing the user's feet. In this paper, we address the question if the virtual self-representation of the user's feet changes the detection thresholds for translation gains. Furthermore, we consider the influence of the holisticness of the visual stimulus, i. e., the type of virtual environment. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to identify detection thresholds for translation gains under three different conditions: (i) without visible virtual feet and (ii) with visible virtual feet both in a high fidelity visually rich virtual environment, and (iii) with visible virtual feet in a low cue virtual environment. The results revealed the range of detection thresholds for translations gains, which cannot be detected by the user when the feet are visible. Furthermore, the results show a significant difference between the two types of environment. Our findings suggest that the virtual environment is more important for manipulation detection than the visual self-representation of the user's feet.},

  title={Augmented Rotations in Virtual Reality for Users with a Reduced Range of Head Movement},
  author={Norouzi, N and B{\"o}lling, L and Bruder, G and Welch, G},
  year={2018},
  abstract={
  * A large body of research in the field of virtual reality (VR) is focused on making user interfaces more natural and intuitive by leveraging natural body movements to explore a virtual environment.
     * For example, head-tracked user interfaces allow users to naturally look around a virtual space by moving their head. 
     * However, such approaches may not be appropriate for users with temporary or permanent limitations of their head movement. 
  * In this paper, we present techniques that allow these users to get full-movement benefits from a reduced range of physical movements. 
     * Specifically, we describe two techniques that augment virtual rotations relative to physical movement thresholds.
     * We describe how each of the two techniques can be implemented with either a head tracker or an eye tracker, e.g., in cases when no physical head rotations are possible. 
     * We discuss their differences and limitations and we provide guidelines for the practical use of such augmented user interfaces.
