\chapter{Choice of methods (2-5 pages)}
This section is to include a description of the methods to be used,
including references to literature describing the methods to be used
(e.g. qualitative, quantitative, interviews, surveys,
questionnaire,  model building etc.)
For each of the research questions to be addressed,
the chapter is to explain why the method is
\begin{itemize}
\item appropriate
\item likely to provide the desired knowledge/information.
\end{itemize}

    * Gain thresholds/General RW papers
        * Papers were picked for reading as long as title/abstract focused on factors related to general user comfort and detection/gain thresholds for RW
        * (There are several papers on redirection using eye saccades or eye blinks, but these are not as relevant for the consumer headsets we have today as they require special hardware)
        * 4(5 if you count Bj√∏rn's master thesis) relevant papers found using Google Scholar with after 2014 as filter
        * 5 relevant papers found using IEEEXplore
    * Distractors
       * first search was primarily conducted to look for state of the art applications of distractors
       * A second search was also conducted to get more background literature
