\chapter{Feasibility study (1/2-3 pages)}
An analysis of why it is likely that the desired
results can be produced within the given time and
resource bounds.  This may include a description of
\begin{itemize}
\item similar projects completed by others and their 'resource consumption',
\item an attempt to answer parts of the research questions
\item the 'difficult' elements of the work and an explanation of why/how these problems can be solved.  
Alternatively you can explain an 'approximate' solution.
\end{itemize}
