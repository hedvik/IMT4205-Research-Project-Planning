\chapter{Choice of methods (2-5 pages)}\label{chap:methods}
This section is to include a description of the methods to be used,
including references to literature describing the methods to be used
(e.g. qualitative, quantitative, interviews, surveys,
questionnaire,  model building etc.)
For each of the research questions to be addressed,
the chapter is to explain why the method is
\begin{itemize}
\item appropriate
\item likely to provide the desired knowledge/information.
\end{itemize}

\caption{List over keywords and combinations that were used for the literature search}
\label{table:literaturekeywords}
\end{table}
    
    * Gain thresholds/General RW papers
        * Papers were picked for reading as long as title/abstract focused on factors related to general user comfort and detection/gain thresholds for RW
        * (There are several papers on redirection using eye saccades or eye blinks, but these are not as relevant for the consumer headsets we have today as they require special hardware)
        * 4(5 if you count Bj√∏rn's master thesis) relevant papers found using Google Scholar with after 2014 as filter
        * 5 relevant papers found using IEEEXplore
    * Distractors
       * first search was primarily conducted to look for state of the art applications of distractors
       * A second search was also conducted to get more background literature
          * First three pages was scanned through for background
    * Search terms from APW
       * Cinematic VR and guiding attention is a related field
       * Some literature was acquired from this field
       * TODO: Add these to the list as they provided some relevant papers and mention the context of the search
    * Similar searches were also conducted with the ACM digital library, but these searches did not provide any additional literature that already were found in other searches. Thus these queries are not included in the table.

\section{Measuring Effectiveness of Redirected Walking}

\section{Plan For Experimental Environment}
\subsection{Technology}
* Unity
   * RDW Toolkit, might require some adaptions as it is made in a older version of Unity
* Vive Pro
\subsubsection{Physical Space}
* A 10m x 10m environment would be preferred to make best use of redirection techniques and the Vive Pro's additional tracking length.
