\chapter{Milestones, deliverables and resources (2-5 pages)}
The purpose of this chapter is to convince the reader that you know exactly what to do.
This chapter gives a description of how the project is to be
broken down into smaller parts and activities.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  What is it you have to do in order to obtain the desired knowledge?
\item  What deliverables are to be produced (MSc thesis report, software,...)
\item  When are the various deliverables going to be available?
\end{enumerate}

For each deliverable, identify 4 versions, having an
'increasing' degree of completeness/quality.
Students are strongly recommended to review each others drafts.
For each version of a deliverable explain why and how this version is to
be better/more complete.  E.g. v1.0: my first draft -
chapter text includes 1/2 page summaries only.
v.2.0: Like v1.0, but comments by NN(who? fellow student)
has been incorporated. v3.0:....

This section is to include a preliminary table of contents for the MSc thesis
(only include 2 levels).

For each of the activities identified, specify
\begin{enumerate}
\item  the time you need to complete each activity both calendar time and 'man-hours'.
\item  hours needed by you
\item  things you need to buy (consumables)
\item  equipment, lab space or facilities you need access to
\item  contributions from others (e.g. survey/interview participants) and how much each will have to contribute in terms of resources (probably time)
\end{enumerate}
At the beginning of this section, provide a 2-3 line summary of the
resource requirements.  This is particularly useful if you have broken
down the task into a lot of small tasks.
