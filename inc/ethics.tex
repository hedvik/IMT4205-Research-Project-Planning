\chapter{Ethical and legal considerations (1/4-1 page)} \label{chap:ethics}
The purpose of this chapter is to convince the
reader and your self that your project activities are
\begin{itemize}
\item legal
\item ethical, e.g. don't use/distribute/collect etc. data in such a way that individuals may suffer.
\end{itemize}
For example, if you are planning to do reverse engineering activities, surveys, PENTESTING- (both technical and based on social engineering techniques) you need to be particularly careful and check with the appropriate experts and authorities if the activity is permitted.  An explanation of why your project is both legal and ethical should be given in this chapter.

If you need permission (e.g. because you will be collecting or processing privacy related information), 
you should  include the appropriate applications/application forms and ensure that these applications 
are submitted well before you need the permission.
